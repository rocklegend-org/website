    <p>Hey {{$username}}!<br />
        We're writing you to ask you for your help!<br /><br />
        Since we started developing <a href="http://rocklegend.org" target="_blank">rocklegend</a> in 2014, we managed to get a lot of things done!<br />
        <b>Closed Alpha started in June</b>, then we opened for everyone with the <i>open beta in december</i><br />
        and now we want to redesign rocklegend in order to make it the best experience possible.
    </p>
    <p><b>BUT,</b> to make this work, we need <b>YOUR</b> help {{$username}}!<br /><br />
        Most people don't know that we are only two people -> one developer and one marketing and sales expert,<br />
        and we don't have much expertise in designing stuff.<br />
        That's why we want to hire a designer to <b>design the new rocklegend website</b>.<br />
    </p>
    <img src="{{$url}}/assets/images/frontend/drumsticks-preview.jpg" alt="the drumsticks are a perk!" />
    <p>We have a ton of features and enhancements planned for this year,<br />and since we're doing all of this in
        our spare time, and there's no kind of funding whatsoever,<br />we would like to ask our fans to help us out and
        help speeding up development by crowdfunding our next steps!</p>
    <p>For detailed information and an overview of all the <b>LEGENDARY PERKS</b>
        check out <a href="http://bit.ly/1yzjKNc" target="_blank">the rocklegend campaign on indiegogo.com</a>!</p>
    <p>Thanks so much for your support and happy playing,
        <br />
        Patrick and Michael - the founders of rocklegend
    </p>
