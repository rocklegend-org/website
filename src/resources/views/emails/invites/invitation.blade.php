					there's also the track editor, this is the tool which is used to create new tracks for rocklegend, and all the songs you can currently play were made by early access users using this tool!<br /><br />
					</p>
					<hr style="color: #40cbeb; background-color: #40cbeb; border: 1px solid #df5e7a;" />
					<p>
					a big thanks at this point to the amazing <a href="https://www.facebook.com/escapeartistsvienna" alt="Escape Artists">Escape Arists</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theeccos" alt="The Eccos">The Eccos</a> for their trust and support!<br />make sure to check them out, <b>without them there would be no rocklegend</b>, so, like their facebook pages and listen to their songs :)</p>
					<hr style="color: #40cbeb; background-color: #d5c600; border: 1px solid #d5c600;" />
					<p>
					the track editor is still in its early days, and every feedback you have is greatly appreciated.<br /><br />
					the next feature test is going to be the track player. as soon as we activate this part, you will be able to play the songs you, and others have tracked.</p>
					<hr style="color: #a4e240; background-color: #a4e240; border: 1px solid #a4e240;" />
